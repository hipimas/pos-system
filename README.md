Install sample projects to support programming exercises for a training course in Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Design in Java. These instructions are used by an instructor preparing a VM to be copied and distributed to participants in the class.

These instructions assume you are starting with a VM that has been provisioned using provision-java-dev-training-vm, available on Github. Alternatively, you may provision a target environment manually in any way you wish, provided the environment can run the course project(s).
